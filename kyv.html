    <h1>Know Your Volunteers</h1>
    <p>
      RakshaX works with verified women volunteers  
      who are ready to help during emergencies —  
      safely, responsibly, and with respect for privacy.

    <h2>Who Are RakshaX Volunteers?</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      RakshaX volunteers are verified women from nearby communities
      who choose to assist during SOS situations.
      They are not random users — each volunteer goes through
      a structured verification and approval process.
